## History

When my family got our first computer, I was 6 years old and couldn’t care less.

When my dad bought a copy of [“The Complete Idiot's Guide To Creating A Web Page”](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Creating-CDROM/dp/078971146X) three years later, I was enthralled. Suddenly it clicked that the art I loved to make in the real world, I could make on a computer! Over the next two years I would teach myself HTML 4.0, and discover that it was fun to make computers do what I told them (most of the time).

It started a lifelong obsession, first web, then 3D modelling, then graphic design and photo manipulation. At 16, I began working for a local web shop as a graphic designer. I’ve worked for that same little web shop (which we’ve grown into a two-city-and-growing marketing company with clients across the country) ever since, growing and expanding my knowledge.

When I was in college, sick of school and tired of feeling like a hack at work, I shifted my focus towards real programming. No more getting by on some advanced-level IT knowledge and enough PHP to fix some Wordpress theme bugs. I re-invigorated myself to learn the fundamentals of programming, and learn them well.

Since then I've stayed hungry and excited to learn more and more about programming, computer science fundamentals, and the way our world uses, relies on, and grows as a result of computer technology.

## This Site

This website is built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and is deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). The theme is custom, but took lots of inspiration by from Hexo Magnetic theme by [Jonathan Klughertz](http://www.codeblocq.com/).

<!-- Some people may wonder why, as a developer and designer, I would use a theme and deploy to simplified system. It's simple: we all build on the progress of others, and getting something done is more important than doing it yourself. Had I tried to design and build a whole system from scratch (I did) I wouldn't finish it, and I would have just sat on it for one year, four months, and roughly 12 days (I did). -->

## Other Interests

It’s not all 1s and 0s! I’m an avid singer/songwriter and have played piano most of my life, picking up some trombone, banjo, accordion, harmonica, and bass along the way. Not surprising, I’m a huge lover of synthesizers (music AND computers? Come on…) and have released [an album of synthwave music](https://videohomesystem.bandcamp.com) with my brother Andrew.

I’m also a film-obsessive, dabbling in filmmaking since college. I’ve been a major part of 8 short film projects, written one short that’s never been produced (not yet), and have crewed on feature films, web series, and more. On the side, I’m a videographer for [Double Springs Media](https://vimeo.com/doublespringsmedia), and a regular volunteer with [Sidewalk Film Festival](https://sidewalkfest.com).
